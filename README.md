## Music Tours Analysis
## **Overview**
This project contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the highest-grossing music tours by artists. The analysis examines various aspects of tour performance including gross revenue, adjusted revenue (in 2022 dollars), number of shows, and average revenue per show.

## Analysis Overview
The analysis includes:
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Removing unnecessary columns
Renaming columns for clarity
Converting financial figures from string to numeric format
Extracting end years from year ranges

## Key Findings

1. Taylor Swift's "The Eras Tour" leads with the highest gross revenue ($780,000,000) and highest average per show ($13,928,571)
2. The top 3 artists by total average gross are:
- Taylor Swift
- Beyonc√©
- Madonna
3. Tours with fewer shows often have higher per-show revenue
Modern tours (2023-2024) tend to generate higher average revenue per show than older tours
